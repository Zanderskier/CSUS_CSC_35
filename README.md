This Repository contains my final project for my Intro to Computer Architecture Class

It is a text based game where the player must manage their Health, Stamina, and Sanity while attempting to escape the cursed forest.
Along the way they will have to fight monsters, experience hallucinations, and hidden locations. The player is not only attempting to not get killed
by one of the monsters, but they must escape before time runs out as they only have 120 days before they will go insane in the forest.
